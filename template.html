    <p>When researching climate change it's very hard to find reliable research so I went to the WHO website (World Health Organization) to find some data about climate change and the effect it has on people's health well in this data it mostly about children's health in low/mid income. In 2004 climate change killed approximately 39 kids out of 100,000 meaning that every 100,000 deaths with kids under five 39 of them were killed by climate change in Africa. In North America only 1 child out of 100,000 will die due to the climate change (under five as well). And the last one I want to look at is the deaths in Europe, which is surprisingly only 2 per 100,000 deaths under five.</p>

  <p>We do have to remember that this data was taken in 2004 meaning it was taken 15 years ago and a lot has changed between then and the deaths have most likely gone up a lot. The last data that I would like to look at is the Deaths caused by air pollution in Canada during 2016. Approximately 5335 people died due to air pollution in Canada. They either died of a Lower respiratory infection, Trachea, bronchus, lung cancer, Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

  <p>For my Secondary Research I went on the web and I found an article on NRDC by Noah Long and Kevin Steinberger. In the text it states that wind and solar energy has become increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the country. This clean energy has in some places become cheaper than the other non-clean versions.The investment firm Lazard estimates that the cost of generating electricity from wind and solar has declined by 58 percent and 78 percent from 2009. In the long term, the U.S. EPACPP (Environmental Protection Agencyâ€™s Clean Power Plan) plans to put the first national limits on carbon pollution from power plants and will continue to drive renewable energy growth.Wind and solar energy will play big role in achieving the emissions cuts required. The LBNL Laboratory found that in 2013 alone, renewable standards across the country saved customers up to $1.2 billion.</p>
